<div align="justify"><p>There are lots of ways to create web pages using already coded programmes. These lessons will teach you how to use the underlying HyperText Markup Language -  HTML. 
<br>
</p><p>HTML isn't computer code, but is a language that uses US English to enable texts (words, images, sounds) to be inserted and formatting such as colo(u)r and centre/ering to be written in. The process is fairly simple; the main difficulties often lie in small mistakes - if you slip up while word processing your reader may pick up your typos, but the page will still be legible. However, if your HTML is inaccurate the page may not appear - writing web pages is, at the least, very good practice for proof reading!</p>

<p>Learning <i><b>HTML</b></i> will enable you to:
</p><ul>
<li>create your own simple pages
</li><li>read and appreciate pages created by others
</li><li>develop an understanding of the creative and literary implications of web-texts
</li><li>have the confidence to branch out into more complex web design 
</li></ul><p></p>

<p> To make a simple web page you need to know only four tags:
</p>
<p>All these tags need to be closed.

</p><h4>EXERCISE</h4>

<p>Write a <u>simple</u> web page.</p>
<p> Copy out exactly the HTML below, using a WP program such as Notepad.<br>
Information in <i>italics</i> indicates where you can insert your own text, other information is HTML and needs to be exact. However, make sure there are no spaces between the tag brackets and the text inside.<br>
(Find Notepad by going to the START menu\ PROGRAMS\ ACCESSORIES\ NOTEPAD). 
</p><p>
Make another page. Call it somethingdifferent.html and place it in the same WEBPAGES folder as detailed above.
</p><p>start formatting in <a href="webpage2.html">lesson two</a>
<br><a href="col3.html">back to first lesson</a> </p>
